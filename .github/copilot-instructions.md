# ESP32 Distance Sensor Project - GitHub Copilot Instructions

You are working on an ESP32-based IoT distance sensor project that measures distance using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and displays results on a WS2812 LED strip. The project includes WiFi connectivity, a web interface with captive portal, and is being enhanced with HTTPS security.

## Project Context

### Hardware Stack

## Project-Specific Instructions

### Memory Management

- **Always consider ESP32 memory constraints** when suggesting code changes
- **Use FreeRTOS-specific memory functions** (`heap_caps_malloc`, `heap_caps_free`)
- **Check available heap** before allocating large buffers
- **Prefer stack allocation** for small, temporary variables
- **Use IRAM_ATTR** sparingly and only when necessary

### ESP-IDF Best Practices

- **Use component-based architecture** for new functionality
- **Include proper error handling** with ESP_ERROR_CHECK() and ESP_LOG functions
- **Follow ESP-IDF naming conventions** (esp_, ESP_, CONFIG_)
- **Use appropriate log levels** (ESP_LOGI, ESP_LOGW, ESP_LOGE, ESP_LOGD)
- **Handle WiFi events properly** using event handlers

### Hardware-Specific Considerations

- **GPIO pin assignments**: Document and validate pin usage before modifications
- **Timing constraints**: HC-SR04 requires precise timing (10Œºs trigger, timeout handling)
- **LED strip timing**: WS2812 requires specific bit timing (T0H, T1H, TL, TH)
- **Power management**: Consider current draw when adding new peripherals

### Security Implementation

- **Current focus**: HTTPS implementation for secure web interface
- **Certificate management**: Automated self-signed certificate generation
- **Memory efficient SSL**: Optimize SSL buffer sizes for ESP32 constraints
- **HTTP to HTTPS redirection**: Maintain user-friendly access patterns

### Requirements Engineering

- **Methodology**: Follow OpenFastTrack (OFT) requirements engineering methodology
- **Requirement IDs**: Use format `REQ-<AREA>-<NUMBER>` (e.g., `REQ-CFG-1`, `REQ-WEB-3`)
- **Traceability**: Maintain bidirectional traceability from requirements ‚Üí design ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí tests
- **Location**: Requirements stored in `docs/requirements/` with detailed `.md` format
- **Current Focus**: Configuration management requirements (`config-requirements.md`)
- **Implementation Links**: Code must reference specific requirement IDs in comments for traceability

## Important Notes

### When Suggesting Code Changes

1. **Always consider ESP32 memory constraints** and current usage (41% flash free)
2. **Maintain component-based architecture** - don't put everything in main.c
3. **Use proper ESP-IDF error handling** and logging
4. **Test memory impact** of new features using `idf.py size`
5. **Document GPIO pin usage** when adding new hardware interfaces

### When Working with Network Code

1. **Handle WiFi disconnection gracefully** - implement reconnection logic
2. **Use proper event handling** for WiFi and IP events
3. **Consider both AP and STA modes** in networking code
4. **Implement timeouts** for network operations
5. **Test captive portal compatibility** across different devices

### When Implementing HTTPS Features

1. **Optimize SSL buffer sizes** for ESP32 memory constraints
2. **Use self-signed certificates** for local IoT device security
3. **Implement HTTP‚ÜíHTTPS redirection** for user experience
4. **Test certificate acceptance** across different browsers
5. **Document security configuration** for end users

## Quality Gates for Coding Agent

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Run Quality Checks BEFORE Every Commit

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW for GitHub Copilot Coding Agent:**

```bash
# 1. BEFORE committing ANY documentation changes:
markdownlint --fix docs/**/*.md *.md

# 2. BEFORE committing changes affecting docs/ or mkdocs.yml:
mkdocs build --strict

# 3. If you have pre-commit installed (check with: which pre-commit):
pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure

# 4. ONLY commit if ALL checks pass!
# 5. If checks fail: FIX the issues, then run checks again
# 6. Repeat until all checks pass
```

**WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:**

- You run in a GitHub Actions environment where these tools are available
- CI runs AFTER you commit (too late to fix)
- You will be offline when CI reports errors
- Failed CI blocks PR merge
- Human maintainer has to manually fix your mistakes

**NEVER skip these checks!** Run them BEFORE git commit, not after!

### Pre-commit Quality Checks

This project uses automated quality gates to ensure documentation and code quality. All changes **must pass pre-commit checks** before merging.

#### Automated CI Checks

**GitHub Actions will automatically run** on all PRs and commits to main branches:

- **Markdown linting**: Checks syntax, formatting, and style consistency
- **MkDocs build validation**: Ensures documentation builds without errors
- **Link verification**: Validates all internal and external links

**Environment Setup**: The `.github/actions/setup-coding-agent-env/action.yml` ensures all required tools are available in CI.

#### Required Tools

When working on documentation changes, ensure these tools work:

1. **markdownlint-cli**: Markdown syntax and style validation
2. **mkdocs**: Documentation build system with strict mode
3. **pre-commit**: Automated hook management

#### How to Pass Quality Checks

**If you encounter CI failures:**

1. **Review the GitHub Actions log** for specific errors
2. **Run pre-commit locally** to see detailed output:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure
   ```

3. **Fix common issues:**
   - Add blank lines before/after lists and code blocks
   - Remove trailing whitespace
   - Fix broken links in documentation
   - Ensure proper heading hierarchy

4. **Commit fixes** and push - CI will re-run automatically

#### Quality Check Workflow

```text
Your Changes ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Push ‚Üí PR ‚Üí CI runs pre-commit
                                    ‚Üì
                              Pass? ‚Üí ‚úÖ Ready for review
                                    ‚Üì
                              Fail? ‚Üí ‚ùå Fix issues ‚Üí Push fixes ‚Üí CI re-runs
```

#### Documentation Standards

When modifying Markdown files:

- **Always add blank lines** around lists, code blocks, and headings
- **Use fenced code blocks** with language specifiers: ` ```yaml `
- **Validate links** before committing
- **Test MkDocs build** locally: `mkdocs build --strict`

#### If Tools Are Not Available

If pre-commit tools are not available in your environment:

1. **Document in PR description** that manual quality check is required
2. **Request maintainer to run checks** locally or in CI
3. **Review CI output** carefully and address all reported issues

**Note:** The CI pipeline is the **authoritative quality gate**. All PRs must pass CI checks before merging, regardless of local environment setup.

## Build Environment

Always use the correct build environment setup for Windows:

```powershell
cmd /c "cd /D C:\workspace\ESP32_Projects\distance && C:\workspace\ESP32_Projects\esp\v5.4.1\esp-idf\export.bat && idf.py build"
```
