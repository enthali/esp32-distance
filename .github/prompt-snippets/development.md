## Branch Strategy

### Main Branches

- `develop`: Development integration branch


### Feature Branches

See commit-message.md for branch naming and commit scopes.

## Pull Request Process

1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement changes following coding standards
3. Run pre-commit checks: `pre-commit run --all-files`
4. Submit PR with clear description
5. Address review feedback
6. Merge after approval
