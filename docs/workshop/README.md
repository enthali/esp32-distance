# Workshop: Embedded Vibe-Coding mit GitHub Coding Agent
This section contains the workshop materials. The goal is to give participants hands-on experience working on open-source embedded projects (ESP32 + HC-SR04 + WS2812) using GitHub, Codespaces and Copilot/Coding-Agents.


# 👋 Welcome to the ESP32 Distance Sensor Workshop!

[![Workshop Setup](../assets/images/setup.jpg)](../assets/images/setup.jpg)

Ready to get hands-on with embedded development? This workshop is designed to get you coding on real hardware in **just 5 minutes**—no complicated setup, no frustration!

If you have a private GitHub account and the required hardware on your desk, you can:

1. [**Fork this project**](https://github.com/enthali/esp32-distance/fork)
2. **Create a new Codespace** (just a few clicks)
3. Wait ~5 minutes for setup (all tools & dependencies are installed automatically)
4. Activate the ESP-IDF Web plugin in your codespace
5. Start coding and flashing your ESP32—you're productive immediately!

> **It's really that easy:** From zero to coding on real hardware in minutes. No local installs, no driver hassle, no toolchain pain.
