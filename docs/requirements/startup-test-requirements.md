# Startup Test Requirements

**Document ID**: REQ-STARTUP-ESP32-DISTANCE  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-09-16  
**Author**: ESP32 Distance Project Team  
**Parent Document**: SRS-ESP32-DISTANCE  

## Document Purpose

This document specifies requirements for the startup test sequence that provides visual feedback to users during system initialization, demonstrating hardware functionality and successful boot.

## Requirements Traceability

| Requirement ID | Design Reference | Priority |
|----------------|------------------|----------|
| REQ-STARTUP-1  | DSN-STARTUP-1    | Mandatory |
| REQ-STARTUP-2  | DSN-STARTUP-2    | Mandatory |
| REQ-STARTUP-3  | DSN-STARTUP-3    | Important |

**Dependencies**:

- REQ-STARTUP-2 depends on REQ-LED-1 (cannot test LEDs without LED controller support)

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-STARTUP-1: LED Controller Initialization

**Type**: Functional  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL initialize the LED controller during startup before performing the visual test sequence.

**Rationale**: LED hardware must be ready before the startup sequence can execute.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: LED controller SHALL be initialized successfully during startup
- AC-2: System SHALL proceed to visual sequence only after successful LED initialization

**Verification**: Verify LED controller initializes without errors during system startup.

### REQ-STARTUP-2: Visual Boot Sequence

**Type**: User Experience  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL display a visual boot sequence by lighting LEDs in sequential order from first to last, providing clear indication that the system is initializing and all LEDs are functional.

**Rationale**: Gives users immediate visual feedback that the device is booting properly and demonstrates that all LEDs in the strip are working correctly.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: LEDs SHALL light sequentially from position 0 to position (led_count-1)
- AC-2: Each LED SHALL display a distinct color during the sequence (e.g., blue or white)
- AC-3: Test SHALL complete within reasonable time limits (example: 40 LEDs @ 50ms each = 2.0 second maximum)
- AC-4: Each LED SHALL turn off before the next LED activates (single moving light pattern)
- AC-5: Normal distance measurement SHALL begin after sequence completes

**Verification**: Observe startup sequence, verify all LEDs activate in order with appropriate timing and visual clarity.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### REQ-STARTUP-3: Timing Performance

**Type**: Performance  
**Priority**: Important  
**Description**: The startup test sequence SHALL complete within reasonable time limits to avoid significantly delaying normal system operation.

**Rationale**: Users expect reasonable boot times; startup test should provide value without excessive delay.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: Complete startup sequence SHALL finish within 5 seconds for 60 LEDs
- AC-2: LED activation timing SHALL be configurable (default 50ms per LED)
- AC-3: Total startup delay SHALL not exceed 10 seconds regardless of LED count

**Verification**: Measure startup sequence timing with different LED counts, verify performance meets timing requirements.

## Requirements Summary

**Total Requirements**: 3

- **Functional**: 2 requirements (LED initialization, visual sequence)
- **Non-Functional**: 1 requirement (timing performance)

**Priority Distribution**:

- **Mandatory**: 2 requirements
- **Important**: 1 requirement

**Key Benefits**:

- **User Confidence**: Clear visual feedback that system is working properly
- **LED Validation**: Demonstrates all LEDs in the strip are functional
- **Professional Appearance**: Polished boot experience
