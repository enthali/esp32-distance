# LED Controller Requirements

**Document ID**: REQ-LED-ESP32-DISTANCE  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-09-16  
**Author**: ESP32 Distance Project Team  
**Parent Document**: SRS-ESP32-DISTANCE  

## Document Purpose

This document specifies the essential requirements for WS2812 LED strip control, focusing on user-facing functionality rather than implementation details.

## Requirements Traceability

| Requirement ID | Design Reference | Priority |
|----------------|------------------|----------|
| REQ-LED-1      | DSN-LED-ARCH-01, DSN-LED-TIMING-01 | Mandatory |
| REQ-LED-2      | DSN-LED-ARCH-02, DSN-LED-API-01, DSN-LED-API-02, DSN-LED-ERR-01 | Mandatory |
| REQ-LED-3      | DSN-LED-ARCH-02, DSN-LED-MEM-01, DSN-LED-ERR-01 | Mandatory |
| REQ-LED-4      | DSN-LED-API-02, DSN-LED-DATA-01 | Mandatory |

**Dependencies**:

- REQ-LED-2 depends on REQ-LED-1 (cannot control pixels without hardware support)
- REQ-LED-3 depends on REQ-LED-1 (LED count is hardware configuration parameter)
- REQ-LED-4 depends on REQ-LED-2 (color accuracy requires pixel control)

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-LED-1: WS2812 LED Strip Support

**Type**: Functional  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL support WS2812 addressable LED strips for visual distance display, providing hardware compatibility and initialization.

**Rationale**: WS2812 LEDs are the chosen hardware for distance visualization; system must interface with this specific LED technology.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: System SHALL initialize WS2812 LED strips connected to configurable GPIO pin
- AC-2: System SHALL support WS2812 timing and protocol requirements
- AC-3: LEDs SHALL respond to control signals and display colors
- AC-4: Initialization SHALL handle hardware configuration parameters

**Verification**: Connect WS2812 strip, verify LEDs respond to basic commands and display expected colors.

### REQ-LED-2: Individual Pixel Control

**Type**: Functional  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL provide the ability to set the color of individual LED pixels within the strip for precise distance visualization.

**Rationale**: Distance display requires lighting specific LEDs at calculated positions; individual control is essential for the application.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: System SHALL set specific LED colors by index position
- AC-2: Color control SHALL support RGB color space with 8-bit resolution per channel
- AC-3: Individual LED changes SHALL NOT affect other LEDs
- AC-4: System SHALL provide clear all LEDs functionality

**Verification**: Set individual LEDs to different colors, verify only targeted LEDs change, test clear all functionality.

### REQ-LED-3: Configurable LED Count

**Type**: Functional  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL support configurable LED strip lengths to accommodate different hardware deployments and installation requirements.

**Rationale**: Different installations may use varying LED strip lengths; system must be flexible for deployment scenarios.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: LED count SHALL be configurable during system initialization
- AC-2: System SHALL support LED counts from 1 to at least 100 LEDs
- AC-3: System SHALL validate LED count parameters during configuration
- AC-4: All LED positions within configured count SHALL be controllable

**Verification**: Test with different LED counts, verify all configured LEDs are controllable and out-of-range access is prevented.

### REQ-LED-4: Accurate Color Display

**Type**: Quality  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL display specified RGB colors accurately on WS2812 LEDs for reliable visual feedback to users.

**Rationale**: Color accuracy is essential for distance visualization effectiveness; users must be able to distinguish between different states (normal/error conditions).

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AC-1: Primary colors (red, green, blue) SHALL display distinctly and accurately
- AC-2: White color SHALL appear as true white without color bias
- AC-3: Black/off state SHALL turn LEDs completely off
- AC-4: Color transitions SHALL be immediate when hardware is updated

**Verification**: Display primary colors and verify visual accuracy, test white balance and off state, measure color transition timing.
