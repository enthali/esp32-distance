## System Requirements

### REQ-SYS-1: ESP32 Hardware Platform
**Type**: System  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL operate on ESP32 WROOM-32F microcontroller with 4MB flash memory.

**Rationale**: ESP32 provides WiFi connectivity, sufficient processing power, and adequate flash memory for the application.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC-1: System boots successfully on ESP32 WROOM-32F
- AC-2: Flash usage does not exceed 90% of available 4MB
- AC-3: System operates within ESP32 memory constraints

### REQ-SYS-2: Real-time Distance Measurement
**Type**: Functional  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL continuously measure distance and update LED display in real-time.

**Rationale**: Core functionality for distance visualization and monitoring.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC-1: Distance measurements updated at minimum 10Hz frequency
- AC-2: LED display reflects distance changes within 100ms
- AC-3: System maintains real-time performance under all operating conditions

### REQ-SYS-3: WiFi Connectivity
**Type**: Functional  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL provide WiFi connectivity in both Access Point (AP) and Station (STA) modes.

**Rationale**: Enables web interface access and network configuration.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC-1: System creates WiFi Access Point for initial configuration
- AC-2: System connects to existing WiFi networks as station
- AC-3: Automatic fallback to AP mode if STA connection fails

### REQ-SYS-4: Web-based Configuration
**Type**: Functional  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL provide web interface for configuration and monitoring.

**Rationale**: User-friendly interface for system setup and operation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC-1: Web interface accessible via HTTP
- AC-2: Configuration changes applied without firmware recompilation
- AC-3: Real-time monitoring of system status and sensor data

### REQ-SYS-5: Non-volatile Configuration Storage
**Type**: Functional  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL persist configuration settings across power cycles.

**Rationale**: Maintains user settings and system configuration permanently.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC-1: Configuration survives device reset and power loss
- AC-2: Factory reset capability restores default settings
- AC-3: Configuration corruption detection and recovery

### REQ-SYS-6: Component-based Architecture
**Type**: Design  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL implement modular component-based architecture.

**Rationale**: Enables maintainability, testability, and reusability.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC-1: Distance sensor implemented as independent component
- AC-2: LED controller implemented as independent component
- AC-3: Components provide well-defined APIs
- AC-4: Main application coordinates components without tight coupling

### REQ-SYS-7: Error Handling and Recovery
**Type**: Reliability  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL handle errors gracefully and attempt recovery.

**Rationale**: Ensures system reliability and user experience.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC-1: Sensor timeouts handled without system crash
- AC-2: WiFi connection failures trigger automatic retry
- AC-3: System logs errors for diagnostics
- AC-4: Watchdog timer prevents system hang

### REQ-SYS-8: Memory Management
**Type**: Performance  
**Priority**: Mandatory  
**Description**: The system SHALL manage memory efficiently within ESP32 constraints.

**Rationale**: Prevents memory leaks and ensures stable operation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC-1: Heap usage monitored and bounded
- AC-2: No memory leaks during normal operation
- AC-3: Stack overflow protection for all tasks
- AC-4: Dynamic allocation minimized in time-critical paths

## Compliance and Validation

### Traceability
All requirements SHALL be traceable to:
- Design specifications in `docs/design/`
- Implementation in `main/` and `components/`
- Test cases in `docs/test/`

### Validation Method
- **Inspection**: Code review and documentation review
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, system tests  
- **Analysis**: Static analysis and memory profiling
- **Demonstration**: Live system demonstration

### Change Management
- Requirements changes tracked through Git version control
