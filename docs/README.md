## OpenFastTrack (OFT) Integration

This project demonstrates **AI-assisted embedded development** with formal requirements engineering:

### Requirements Engineering Process
1. **Requirements**: Written in OFT format with unique IDs and traceability
2. **Design**: Linked to requirements with clear traceability
3. **Implementation**: Components linked to design specifications
4. **Testing**: Test cases linked to requirements for coverage verification

### AI Development Workflow
- **GitHub Copilot**: Assigned complete requirement sections for implementation
- **Requirements-Driven Development**: AI implements against formal specifications
- **Automated Traceability**: OFT tracks requirement→design→code→test links
- **Quality Gates**: Formal validation at each development phase

## Target Audience

This project serves as a **demonstration** for:
- **Safety-Critical Development Teams**: Showing AI integration with formal processes
- **Embedded Systems Engineers**: Modern development practices for ESP32/IoT
- **Requirements Engineers**: OFT methodology in practice
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Copilot integration with structured development

## Getting Started

1. **Read System Requirements**: Start with `requirements/system-requirements.md`
2. **Review Architecture**: See `design/system-architecture.md`
3. **Follow Implementation**: Track requirement implementation through OFT traceability
4. **Validate Testing**: Verify requirement coverage in test specifications

## Tools and Standards

- **OpenFastTrack**: Requirements traceability and validation
- **GitHub Copilot**: AI-assisted implementation
- **ESP-IDF**: ESP32 development framework
- **Markdown**: Human-readable documentation format
- **Git**: Version control with OFT-friendly plain text format

## Development Philosophy

This project demonstrates that **formal processes and AI assistance are complementary**, showing how:
- Structured requirements enable better AI code generation
- AI tools can work within safety-critical development frameworks
- Modern tooling can make formal processes more efficient
- Embedded systems can benefit from both rigor and automation
