# ESP32 Distance Project - Feature Intentions

This document contains **unnumbered** feature intentions that may or may not be implemented. These are flexible ideas that can be reordered, modified, or moved to the planned roadmap as priorities become clear.

> **⚠️ Important**: Not all features listed here will be implemented! Some may never see the light of day. This is a wishlist, brainstorming document, and collection of "wouldn't it be nice if..." ideas. Think of it as a feature backlog where items live until they either:
>
> - ✅ Get promoted to actual planned features
> - 📦 Stay here indefinitely as "someday/maybe" ideas
> - 🗑️ Get removed as "not worth doing"
>
> Don't assume anything here will actually happen! 😊

## HTTPS Security Implementation 💭 **on Hold**

- 💭 **HTTPS Server**: Replace HTTP with encrypted HTTPS using ESP32 SSL/TLS support
- 💭 **Self-Signed Certificates**: Generate and embed certificates for local IoT device use
- 💭 **Certificate Generation**: Build-time certificate creation and embedding
- 💭 **Mixed Mode Support**: HTTPS for production, HTTP fallback for development
- 💭 **Browser Compatibility**: Handle self-signed certificate warnings appropriately

## OTA Firmware Updates 💭

- **Over-The-Air Updates**: ESP32 OTA partition scheme and update mechanism
- **Version Management**: Firmware versioning and rollback capability
- **Update Server**: Simple HTTP/HTTPS server for firmware distribution
- **Security**: Signed firmware updates and secure boot
- **User Interface**: Web-based firmware update with progress indication

## Configuration Management 💭

- **POST Handler Implementation**: Handle configuration save requests from web interface
- **Settings Persistence**: Store distance range, LED brightness, WiFi credentials to NVS (Non-Volatile Storage)
- **Configuration API**: RESTful endpoints for GET/POST configuration data
- **Runtime Updates**: Apply configuration changes without device restart (where possible)
- **Factory Reset**: Restore default configuration option
- **Configuration Validation**: Input validation and error handling for settings
- **JSON Configuration**: Structured configuration format for easy parsing

## Development Environment & Tooling 💭

### Requirements Engineering & Traceability

- **Sphinx Integration**: Use Sphinx-Needs for requirements management and traceability
- **Requirement Traceability Matrix**: Automated tracking from requirements → design → implementation → tests
- **Requirements Completion**: Complete requirement specification coverage for all features
- **Bidirectional Traceability**: Link code back to requirements (REQ-IDs in comments)
- **Requirements Documentation**: Structured requirement documents with versioning

### API Documentation

- **Automated API Docs**: Generate API documentation from code using Doxygen or Sphinx
- **Component Documentation**: Auto-generate component interface documentation
- **Header Documentation**: Ensure all public functions have complete Doxygen comments
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Auto-generated call graphs and dependency diagrams
- **Documentation Website**: Hosted documentation with API reference

### Test Automation (CT - Continuous Testing)

- **Unit Test Framework**: ESP-IDF Unity test framework integration
- **Component Testing**: Unit tests for each component (distance_sensor, led_controller, etc.)
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and system behavior
- **Hardware-in-Loop (HIL)**: Automated testing with physical hardware
- **Emulator Testing**: Automated QEMU-based testing in CI/CD pipeline
- **Test Coverage**: Code coverage reporting and analysis
- **Regression Testing**: Automated test suite execution on every commit
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor memory usage, timing, and resource utilization

### CI/CD Pipeline enhancements

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated build and test on push/PR
- **Build Validation**: Ensure clean builds for both hardware and emulator targets
- **Test Execution**: Run unit and integration tests automatically
- **Documentation Build**: Auto-build and deploy documentation
- **Firmware Artifacts**: Generate and publish firmware binaries
- **Quality Gates**: Enforce code quality, test coverage thresholds

### Code Quality Tools

- **Static Analysis**: Cppcheck, clang-tidy for C code analysis
- **Linting**: Consistent code style enforcement
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated formatting and validation before commits
- **Memory Analysis**: Stack usage analysis and heap leak detection
- **Dependency Analysis**: Component dependency visualization

## Security Hardening 💭 **INTENDED**

- **WiFi Security**: WPA3 support and strong encryption
- **Web Interface Security**: HTTPS, session management, CSRF protection
- **Access Control**: Basic authentication for configuration pages
- **Network Security**: Firewall rules and secure communication
- **Credential Protection**: Encrypted storage of sensitive data
