### Step 1.2: Ultrasonic Sensor Integration ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ Connect HC-SR04 sensor to designated GPIO pins (Trigger: GPIO14, Echo: GPIO13)
- ✅ Implement distance measurement algorithm with interrupt-driven timing
- ✅ Output readings to serial console with comprehensive logging
- ✅ Calibrate and validate sensor accuracy with temperature compensation

- ✅ **Dual-Queue System**: Implemented non-blocking measurement architecture
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive timeout, range, and validity checks
- ✅ **Integration**: Live distance measurements working in main application

**Deliverables Completed:**

- `components/distance_sensor/` - Interrupt-driven sensor component with dual-queue architecture
- Real-time distance measurements (1Hz) with queue overflow protection
- Complete error handling for timeout, out-of-range, and invalid readings
- Hardware configuration section in `main.c` for centralized pin management

**Technical Achievements:**

- Background FreeRTOS task (Priority 6) for real-time sensor readings
- Non-blocking API with `distance_sensor_get_latest()` for consumer tasks
- Queue overflow detection and statistics for performance monitoring

### Step 1.3: Distance-to-LED Mapping ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ **GitHub Issue Created**: [Feature: Implement LED Distance Visualization with Display Logic Component](copilot_issue_display_logic.md)
- ✅ **Copilot Implementation**: Successfully delivered on `copilot/fix-3` branch (merged)
- ✅ Create `main/display_logic.h/c` - Business logic component for distance visualization
- ✅ Implement distance-to-LED mapping algorithm (10cm-50cm → LEDs 0-39)  
- ✅ Add visual error indicators (red LEDs for out-of-range conditions)
- ✅ **Blocking API Architecture**: Event-driven display updates via blocking distance sensor API
- ✅ Remove background test task from main application flow
- ✅ Add one-time hardware test on startup for LED strip validation
- ✅ **Robust Error Handling**: System restart logic for task failures
- ✅ **Configuration Management**: Single source of truth in main.c

**Completed Architecture:**

```text
Priority 6: Distance Sensor Task  (real-time measurements at 100ms intervals)
Priority 3: Display Logic Task    (event-driven LED visualization)
Priority 1: Main Task             (coordination and health monitoring)
```

**Key Achievements:**

- Distance Range: 10cm to 50cm mapped linearly to 40 LEDs (LED 0 to LED 39)
- Visual Feedback: Green color for normal range, red for error states
- Error Handling: Sensor timeout → all LEDs off, out-of-range → red indicators
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Zero latency LED responses (no timing coordination needed)
- **100ms Measurement Rate**: Highly responsive distance tracking
- **Queue Overflow Elimination**: Blocking API prevents measurement backlog

**Deliverables Completed:**

- `main/display_logic.h/c` - Event-driven LED visualization component
- Blocking distance sensor API for real-time display updates
- Robust system restart logic for critical task failures
- Configuration consolidation following single source of truth principle

## 2 Web Interface Foundation ✅

### Step 2.1: WiFi Setup with Smart Network Logic ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ **Smart WiFi Boot Logic**: Try stored credentials → fallback to AP mode if no config/connection fails
- ✅ **SoftAP Mode**: ESP32 creates "ESP32-Distance-Sensor" network with captive portal
- ✅ **Captive Portal**: Auto-redirect to configuration page with network scanning
- ✅ **Credential Management**: Store WiFi credentials in NVS flash with persistence
- ✅ **Automatic Switching**: Station mode when configured, AP fallback on failure
- ✅ **DNS Server**: Redirect all DNS queries to ESP32 IP for portal detection

**Completed Smart WiFi Behavior:**

1. **Boot Logic**: Try to connect to stored WiFi credentials on startup
2. **Fallback to AP**: If no config or connection fails → start AP mode automatically
3. **AP Mode**: Create "ESP32-Distance-Sensor" network with captive portal
4. **User Configuration**: Web interface to select and configure home WiFi
5. **Automatic Switching**: Once configured, switch to Station mode seamlessly
6. **Persistence**: Store WiFi credentials in NVS flash for future boots

**Components Implemented:**

```c
#include "esp_wifi.h"          // WiFi driver
#include "esp_http_server.h"   // Web server
#include "esp_netif.h"         // Network interface  
#include "nvs_flash.h"         // Credential storage
#include "dns_server.h"        // Captive portal DNS
```

**File Structure Completed:**

- `main/wifi_manager.h/c` - Smart WiFi logic and credential management
- `main/web_server.h/c` - Basic HTTP server for captive portal
- Update `main/CMakeLists.txt` with required ESP-IDF components

**Verified Behavior:**

- **First boot**: Creates AP "ESP32-Distance-Sensor", serves config page at 192.168.4.1
- **After WiFi config**: Connects to home network, serves on assigned IP
