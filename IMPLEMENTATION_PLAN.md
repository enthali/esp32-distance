# ESP32 Distance Project - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
A project that uses an ESP32 to measure distance with an ultrasonic sensor and displays the measurement on a WS2812 LED strip with a web interface.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: LED Strip Animation ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Configure WS2812 LED strip with RMT backend
- ✅ Implement basic LED animations (running light effect)
- ✅ Test all 40 LEDs for proper functionality
- ✅ Verify power requirements and stability
- ✅ Create modular test architecture with background task
- ✅ Implement comprehensive color accuracy and brightness tests
- ✅ **Component Architecture**: Moved `led_controller` to `components/` directory
- ✅ **Refactoring**: Clean API design with proper ESP-IDF component structure

**Deliverables Completed:**
- `components/led_controller/` - Hardware abstraction component
- `main/test/` - Comprehensive test suite with background task support
- Full 40-LED strip validation and power requirements analysis

### Step 2: Ultrasonic Sensor Integration ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Connect HC-SR04 sensor to designated GPIO pins (Trigger: GPIO14, Echo: GPIO13)
- ✅ Implement distance measurement algorithm with interrupt-driven timing
- ✅ Output readings to serial console with comprehensive logging
- ✅ Calibrate and validate sensor accuracy with temperature compensation
- ✅ **Component Architecture**: Moved `distance_sensor` to `components/` directory
- ✅ **Dual-Queue System**: Implemented non-blocking measurement architecture
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive timeout, range, and validity checks
- ✅ **Integration**: Live distance measurements working in main application

**Deliverables Completed:**
- `components/distance_sensor/` - Interrupt-driven sensor component with dual-queue architecture
- Real-time distance measurements (1Hz) with queue overflow protection
- Complete error handling for timeout, out-of-range, and invalid readings
- Hardware configuration section in `main.c` for centralized pin management

**Technical Achievements:**
- Background FreeRTOS task (Priority 6) for real-time sensor readings
- Non-blocking API with `distance_sensor_get_latest()` for consumer tasks
- Queue overflow detection and statistics for performance monitoring

### Step 3: Distance-to-LED Mapping 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** (Assigned to @github-copilot)
- 🔄 **GitHub Issue Created**: [Feature: Implement LED Distance Visualization with Display Logic Component](copilot_issue_display_logic.md)
- 🔄 **Copilot Assignment**: Working on `copilot/fix-3` branch
- ⏳ Create `main/display_logic.h/c` - Business logic component for distance visualization
- ⏳ Implement distance-to-LED mapping algorithm (10cm-50cm → LEDs 0-39)  
- ⏳ Add visual error indicators (red LEDs for out-of-range conditions)
- ⏳ Integrate with existing sensor readings via non-blocking queue API
- ⏳ Remove background test task from main application flow
- ⏳ Add one-time hardware test on startup for LED strip validation

**Planned Architecture:**
```
Priority 6: Distance Sensor Task  (real-time measurements - existing)
Priority 3: Display Logic Task    (NEW - LED visualization)
Priority 2: Test Task             (background only, not started by default)  
Priority 1: Main Task             (coordination only)
```

**Key Requirements:**
- Distance Range: 10cm to 50cm mapped linearly to 40 LEDs (LED 0 to LED 39)
- Visual Feedback: Green/blue for normal range, red for error states
- Error Handling: Sensor timeout → all LEDs off, out-of-range → red indicators
- Update Rate: 1Hz matching sensor measurement interval

### Step 4: Web Interface 📋 **PLANNED**
- 📋 Set up ESP32 as WiFi access point or station
- 📋 Implement HTTP server for web interface  
- 📋 Create responsive webpage displaying real-time distance
- 📋 Add configuration options for distance ranges and LED settings
- 📋 Implement WebSocket for live data streaming
- 📋 Add historical data logging and visualization

**Planned Features:**
- Real-time distance display with LED strip visualization
- Configurable distance ranges and mapping parameters
- LED strip configuration (color schemes, brightness, animation modes)
- Sensor calibration interface (temperature compensation, timeout settings)
- System status monitoring (task health, queue statistics, error logs)
- Data export capabilities (CSV, JSON)

**Technical Architecture:**
- HTTP server with static file serving for web interface
- WebSocket endpoint for real-time data streaming  
- JSON API for configuration and control
- Integration with existing display logic for remote LED control
- WiFi configuration portal for easy network setup
