## Web Interface Foundation ✅

### Step 4.1: WiFi Setup with Smart Network Logic ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ **Smart WiFi Boot Logic**: Try stored credentials → fallback to AP mode if no config/connection fails
- ✅ **SoftAP Mode**: ESP32 creates "ESP32-Distance-Sensor" network with captive portal
- ✅ **Captive Portal**: Auto-redirect to configuration page with network scanning
- ✅ **Credential Management**: Store WiFi credentials in NVS flash with persistence
- ✅ **Automatic Switching**: Station mode when configured, AP fallback on failure
- ✅ **DNS Server**: Redirect all DNS queries to ESP32 IP for portal detection

**Completed Smart WiFi Behavior:**

1. **Boot Logic**: Try to connect to stored WiFi credentials on startup
2. **Fallback to AP**: If no config or connection fails → start AP mode automatically
3. **AP Mode**: Create "ESP32-Distance-Sensor" network with captive portal
4. **User Configuration**: Web interface to select and configure home WiFi
5. **Automatic Switching**: Once configured, switch to Station mode seamlessly
6. **Persistence**: Store WiFi credentials in NVS flash for future boots

**Components Implemented:**

```c
#include "esp_wifi.h"          // WiFi driver
#include "esp_http_server.h"   // Web server
#include "esp_netif.h"         // Network interface  
#include "nvs_flash.h"         // Credential storage
#include "dns_server.h"        // Captive portal DNS
```

**File Structure Completed:**

- `main/wifi_manager.h/c` - Smart WiFi logic and credential management
- `main/web_server.h/c` - Basic HTTP server for captive portal
- Update `main/CMakeLists.txt` with required ESP-IDF components

**Verified Behavior:**

- **First boot**: Creates AP "ESP32-Distance-Sensor", serves config page at 192.168.4.1
- **After WiFi config**: Connects to home network, serves on assigned IP
- **Connection loss**: Retries to connect 3 times with a timeout of 5 sec. then falls back to AP mode automatically
- **Web interface**: Always accessible via current network configuration

**Key Achievements:**
- WiFi captive portal with automatic network detection and configuration
- Full WiFi credential management with NVS persistence  
- Smart boot logic with automatic AP fallback
- Network scanning and selection via web interface
- DNS server for captive portal detection
- Reset functionality to clear credentials and restart in AP mode
- Tested and verified with both AP and STA modes
- Mobile-responsive configuration interface

**Known Issues:**
- **Reset functionality**: Reset endpoint does not always clear NVS credentials as expected (potential need for `nvs_flash_erase()` implementation)
