## 2 Web Interface Foundation ✅

### Step 2.1: WiFi Setup with Smart Network Logic ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ **Smart WiFi Boot Logic**: Try stored credentials → fallback to AP mode if no config/connection fails
- ✅ **SoftAP Mode**: ESP32 creates "ESP32-Distance-Sensor" network with captive portal
- ✅ **Captive Portal**: Auto-redirect to configuration page with network scanning
- ✅ **Credential Management**: Store WiFi credentials in NVS flash with persistence
- ✅ **Automatic Switching**: Station mode when configured, AP fallback on failure
- ✅ **DNS Server**: Redirect all DNS queries to ESP32 IP for portal detection

**Completed Smart WiFi Behavior:**

1. **Boot Logic**: Try to connect to stored WiFi credentials on startup
2. **Fallback to AP**: If no config or connection fails → start AP mode automatically
3. **AP Mode**: Create "ESP32-Distance-Sensor" network with captive portal
4. **User Configuration**: Web interface to select and configure home WiFi
5. **Automatic Switching**: Once configured, switch to Station mode seamlessly
6. **Persistence**: Store WiFi credentials in NVS flash for future boots

**Components Implemented:**

```c
#include "esp_wifi.h"          // WiFi driver
#include "esp_http_server.h"   // Web server
#include "esp_netif.h"         // Network interface  
#include "nvs_flash.h"         // Credential storage
#include "dns_server.h"        // Captive portal DNS
```

**File Structure Completed:**

- `main/wifi_manager.h/c` - Smart WiFi logic and credential management
- `main/web_server.h/c` - Basic HTTP server for captive portal
- Update `main/CMakeLists.txt` with required ESP-IDF components

**Verified Behavior:**

- **First boot**: Creates AP "ESP32-Distance-Sensor", serves config page at 192.168.4.1
- **After WiFi config**: Connects to home network, serves on assigned IP
- **Connection loss**: Retries to connect 3 times with a timeout of 5 sec. then falls back to AP mode automatically
- **Web interface**: Always accessible via current network configuration

**Key Achievements:**

- WiFi captive portal with automatic network detection and configuration

- ✅ **Simple Monitor Function**: Add `distance_sensor_monitor()` function to existing component
- ✅ **Clean Main Loop**: Replace detailed monitoring logic with simple function call
- ✅ **Minimal Changes**: Reuse existing `distance_sensor_get_queue_overflows()` API internally
- ✅ **No New Files**: Keep implementation within existing distance_sensor.c

**Architecture Benefits:**

- **Encapsulated Monitoring**: Distance sensor handles its own health monitoring internally
- **Simplified Main.c**: Main loop calls simple `distance_sensor_monitor()` function
- **Minimal Code Changes**: Reuses existing APIs and infrastructure
- **Resource Efficient**: No additional files, tasks, or complex statistics
- **Clean API**: Monitoring complexity hidden from main.c

**Implementation Completed:**

```c
// In distance_sensor.h - added one function
esp_err_t distance_sensor_monitor(void);

// In distance_sensor.c - encapsulated existing monitoring logic
esp_err_t distance_sensor_monitor(void) {
    // Moved queue overflow checking from main.c
    static uint32_t last_overflow_count = 0;
    uint32_t current_overflows = distance_sensor_get_queue_overflows();
    
    if (current_overflows > last_overflow_count) {
        ESP_LOGW(TAG, "Distance sensor queue overflows: %lu", current_overflows);
        last_overflow_count = current_overflows;
    }
    
    return ESP_OK;

**Final Clean Main.c:**

```c
void app_main(void) {
    // ...initialization...
    
    // Simple, efficient monitoring loop
    while(1) {
        distance_sensor_monitor();   // Lightweight health check (Step 3.1)
        wifi_manager_monitor();      // Connection health and recovery (Step 3.2)
        vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(5000));  // Monitor every 5 seconds
    }
}
```

**Architecture Benefits:**

- **Encapsulated WiFi Monitoring**: WiFi manager handles its own status logging internally
