        help
            Enable this option to build for QEMU emulator instead of real hardware.
            This will use simulator components that provide identical APIs but
            simulate hardware behavior without requiring physical sensors or LEDs.

        bool "Use mocked sensor data in emulator"
        depends on TARGET_EMULATOR
        default y
        help
            Generate simulated distance sensor readings that animate between
            5cm and 60cm in a continuous sweep pattern. This provides visual
            feedback for testing the LED display logic without hardware.
