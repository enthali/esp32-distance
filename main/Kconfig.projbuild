            Build firmware optimized for QEMU emulation. When enabled,
            the build includes emulator-specific drivers and configurations.
            When disabled, builds for physical ESP32 hardware deployment.

        help
            Replaces physical hardware interface drivers with pseudo-virtualized
            emulation inputs. This enables testing application logic with
            simulated sensor data and peripheral responses.
